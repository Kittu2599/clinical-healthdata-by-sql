# CLINICAL-DATA-BY-SQL
Welcome to our comprehensive project designed to guide you through the exciting world of SQL learning! Whether you're a beginner eager to explore the foundations of querying databases or a data enthusiast seeking to refine your data analysis skills, this project is your ultimate resource.

In this project, we've curated a wealth of resources and learning paths that cater to various learning styles and skill levels. Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge and techniques required to effectively use SQL for data analysis.

This is my first SQL project. I used a clinical trial dataset. Here I have started by learning: To design a database, Create a table, Add data to the table, Update the column name, Alter the data in the table, Define the questions that need to be answered, Clean the dataset, and Perform Exploratory Data analysis
